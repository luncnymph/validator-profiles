# Terra Rebels
![](logo.png)

Terra Rebels is a decentralized organization having organically come together with the common goal of revitalizing the Terra Classic ecosystem. Through the efforts of volunteers, we endeavor to provide and deliver software clients to the community and validators.
By reinstating Governance, Staking, and encoding the burn tax into the core protocol, it is our hope to continue serving the community effectively far into the future.
